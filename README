This package is designed to deal with downloading stories from FF.net and,
later, other sites. It requires a fairly recent Python (tested under 3.3.1).

To use, place the ffmirror directory somewhere within the Python load path. Then
place symlinks to the file __main__.py, in PATH or in the directory in which
they will be run, named after the keys of the actions directory in that file
('ffup', 'ffdl', 'ffadd', 'ffcache'). Running each symlink will activate the
appropriate function of __main__.py. The other modules can be used in other
applications for library functionality.

ffdl is a simple one-story downloader. ffadd, ffup and ffcache all deal with an
offline mirror; the location of that mirror is taken to be the current working
directory where the files are run. ffadd will add an author's corpus or
favorites to the current mirror. ffup will update an entire mirror by checking
all authors in it. ffcache will create an index cache file (index.db) required
for using CGI scripts to browse the mirror. The options are all documented by
the usual --help invocation of each command.
