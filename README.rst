ffmirror is a program to create and maintain a local mirror of stories on
fiction-publishing sites. It has functionality for downloading stories similar
to FanFicFare or other projects, but the differentiating factor is support for
creating a local database that maintains downloaded metadata and can
automatically update authors that are followed.
